This capstone project explores the application of data science methodologies to crime analysis in England and Wales, using the county of Essex as a regional case study. With rising crime levels and declining public trust in policing, there is a critical need for localised, transparent, and data-driven solutions. This project addresses this need by integrating exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series forecasting, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to provide meaningful, accessible insights from publicly available crime data.
The core analytical framework includes the use of Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models to forecast crime trends, Random Forest classifiers for anomaly detection, and clustering techniques (K-Means and DBSCAN) to identify geographic crime hotspots. These techniques revealed temporal surges in crime, regional disparities, and strong correlations with socioeconomic deprivation. Notably, the project highlights how deprived areas experience consistently higher crime rates, confirming insights from academic research on inequality and criminal behaviour.
To bridge the gap between complex analytics and public engagement, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot was developed using LangChain and OpenAI embeddings. This tool allows users to query the data conversationally, increasing transparency and usability. An interactive dashboard, hosted on Render, complements the chatbot by visualising crime counts by Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs). The dashboard is accessible by the url https://crime-map-chatbot.onrender.com/ and GitHub repositories https://github.com/cfinal15. 
Despite challenges related to API access, computing limitations, and district boundary effects, the project demonstrates the feasibility and value of integrating machine learning, GIS, and NLP in public sector applications. Ultimately, it offers a replicable model for data-driven regional policing that promotes both strategic decision-making and improved community trust and cohesion.
