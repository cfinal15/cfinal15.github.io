                            <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I was introduced to the elements within the scientific method and explored the various aspects of ethical issues in research, as well as their relevance to professional practice. By the end of the unit, I was able to differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning. I also gained an understanding of why ethics are important and how they relate to my area of research and professional practice.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 2: Research Questions, Literature Review, and Proposal</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I learned how to formulate and revise research questions, examined all the parts that make up a research proposal, and how to present my ideas effectively. By the end of the unit, I could identify suitable research topics and transform them into well-crafted research questions and proposals.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I learned about the three research methods—quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods—and the data collection methods for each. I now understand which methods are suitable for my research area.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observations</h3>
                            <p>This unit introduced me to case studies, focus groups, and observation methods. By the end, I understood how to apply these methods to my investigation and what data each approach yields.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 5: Interviews, Surveys, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I learned about interviews, surveys, and pre- and post-testing. I also explored methods for improving response quality and how to analyse data from different types of questions.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
                            <p>This week focused on understanding quantitative methods, descriptive statistics, and measures of location and spread. By the end, I could apply these techniques effectively.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing</h3>
                            <p>I gained a solid understanding of inferential statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing. By the end of the unit, I could apply these to data analysis and hypothesis testing.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation</h3>
                            <p>I learned how to analyse qualitative and quantitative data, and by the end of the unit, I was able to use various charts and visualisation techniques for presenting data effectively.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 9: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I explored validity, generalisability, and reliability and how they impact research design. I applied this understanding to analyse and present my research findings.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 10: Research Writing</h3>
                            <p>This unit focused on how to structure a dissertation effectively. By the end, I felt confident in my ability to organise and present my research.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 11: Professional Development and e-Portfolio</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I reviewed my learning approach and completed the Professional Skills matrix, which helped clarify my future professional goals.</p>
                        
                            <h3>Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk</h3>
                            <p>In this unit, I learned about project management, risk management, and project life cycles. I developed a risk management plan and understood how to manage project changes.</p>
